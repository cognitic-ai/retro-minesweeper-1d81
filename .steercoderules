This is a clean template for a React project with TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI, React Router, and Lucide Icons.

All source code is in the `src` folder. `App.tsx` is the main entry point and contains all the routes. To add a new route, add a new component in the `src/pages` folder and add it to the `App.tsx` file (before the catch-all `*` route).

To update the default route, edit the `src/pages/Index.tsx` file.

## Styling
To edit the default colors, edit the css variables in `src/index.css`
To edit the theme including animations, edit `tailwind.config.ts`
For styles, always use tailwind v3, DO NOT create new css files.

## Components
All components from shadcn/ui are already installed and ready to use. You can import them with the following syntax:
```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
```
You can use toast from sonner as it's already included in main.tsx:
```tsx
import { toast } from "sonner"
toast("Hello World")
toast.success("Success")
```
Do not use any other toast library.

You can use dark/light mode as the App is already wrapped in a ThemeProvider. You can use ModeToggle to toggle the theme.
```tsx
import { ModeToggle } from "@/components/mode-toggle"
```

## Icons
You can use the following syntax to import icons from lucide-react:
```tsx
import { Moon, Sun } from "lucide-react"
```

## Animations
For animations, motion package (previously framer-motion) is already installed:
```tsx
import { motion } from "motion/react"
```
